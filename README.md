# Final-Project


## Description of What Has Been Implemented
This project analyzes Yellow Taxi,  Uber rides data and historical weather data in New York City to 
explore patterns and trends from January 2020 to August 2024. 

The implementation includes web scraping, data cleaning and preparation, joining datasets, and creating appropriate visualizations

Key analyses involve using SQLAlchemy, and relationship in SQL. 

The weather data are stored in a local directory, while the taxi and Uber data are downloaded programmatically through the code.

A screenshot of the heatmap generated from Visualization 6 is saved as `6.png` and embedded in the Notebook because Github 
prohibits interactive maps. If you download the Jupyter Notebook you should be able to view the interactive map.
