# Final-Project


## Description of What Has Been Implemented
This project analyzes Yellow Taxi,  Uber rides data and historical weather data in New York City to 
explore patterns and trends from January 2020 to August 2024. 

The implementation includes data cleaning and preparation, joining datasets, and creating four structured datasets: 

Key analyses involve using relationship in SQL. 

The project also generates visualizations, such as time-series plots and heatmaps, to provide clear insights into the data.

The weather data is stored in the local directory, while the taxi data is downloaded programmatically through the code.

A screenshot of the heatmap generated from Visualization 6 is saved as `6.png` and embedded in the Notebook because Github 
limits interactive maps. If you download the Jupyter Notebook you should be able to view the map.
